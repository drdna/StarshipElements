# Compare STARFISH output with manual annotations
1. Inspect the [Starfish insert bed file](/data/PyStar.insert.bed) and cross-reference with list of manually annotated elements. Each element is bounded by an "up" flank and a "down" flank. Use the relevant coordinates to check if the starship has the same coordinates as one identified previously by the team. In the following example,

![insert.png](/data/insert.png)

the element is between positions 5,349,244 and 5,449.526 on chromosome 1 of Arcadia2 and is in the reverse orientation.
