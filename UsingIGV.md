# Visualizing Starship flank regions in IGV
1. Open IGV, go the "Genomes" menu and select "Load Genome from File" (note: once you have opened a genome one time, it will be available under the drag down menu on the top left).

2. Navigate to desired genome assembly file and select "Open"
3. Load the associated starship flanks GFF file by selecting the "File -> Load from File" option."

4. Select the GFF file that has the same prefix as the loaded genome file (here the loaded genome is B71v2sh_nh.fasta and the selected GFF file is B71v2sh_nh_Starship_flanks_noclean_recolored.gff).
