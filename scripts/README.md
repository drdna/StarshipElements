# Scripts for Starship Analyses

## 1. Break multifasta files into individual sequences
Simply point the [fasta-break.pl](/scripts/fasta-break.pl) script to the multifasta file needing to be split and provide the name of the directory into which the single fastas should be deposited.

```bash
perl fasta-break.pl MultiFasta.fasta SingleFastaDirectoryName
```
